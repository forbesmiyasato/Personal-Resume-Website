Boomshine Android game developed as the final project for my Java & Android programming class. Was given a 4 day time limit and partnered with Thomas Robasciotti.

Highlight Features: Three types of power-ups which could be purchased through coins that you earn during gameplay, user authentication, storing and retrieving user data such as coin amount, power-upsâ€™ amount, and high scores.
