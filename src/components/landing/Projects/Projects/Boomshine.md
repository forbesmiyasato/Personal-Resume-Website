Boomshine Android game developed as the final project for my Java & Android programming class. Was given a 4 day time limit and worked with one partner.

Active and clear communication together with utilizing design patterns such as factory and strategy allowed us to quickly generate new ideas, implement new features, and fix bugs in the four day time crunch

Highlight Features: Three types of power-ups which could be purchased through coins that you earn during gameplay, user authentication, storing and retrieving user data such as coin amount, power-upsâ€™ amount, and high scores.
